# Module_2_JWhite
VBA module for Jennifer White. 
I included three screenshots of the Excel spreadsheets - one for each year of the stock market data. I have also inlcuded a VBSScript Script file with the code used to generate these spreadsheets.

Instead of attempting to write the VBS in one set of code, I first attempted to perform each task. Once I was confident with the yearly change and total stock volume code, I met with Kat P via AskBCS for guidance with the if/elseif/else statements early on so that I could use one large Sub instead of several.

I met with a study group and we walked through code a tutor showed another student. That was very helpful to talk through errors and wins with other students.

I used https://www.extendoffice.com/documents/excel/5333-excel-run-macro-multiple-sheets.html to help with the multiple sheets aspect. There was a flaw in that site's code, so Asiha, a tutor, helped me with getting the code to replicate past the second tab.
